# COBOL Banking Demo Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Demo-Ready Code
All code must be demonstration-ready at all times. Features should be simple, clear, and easy to explain during presentations. Focus on showcasing COBOL capabilities in a banking context.

### II. COBOL Best Practices
Follow standard COBOL conventions and readability guidelines. Code should demonstrate proper COBOL structure, including IDENTIFICATION, ENVIRONMENT, DATA, and PROCEDURE divisions with clear organization.

### III. No Testing Required
Given this is a demo application, formal unit testing and test-driven development are not required. Focus on functional demonstration rather than test coverage.

### IV. Banking Domain Focus
All features must align with banking domain concepts: account management, transactions, balance inquiries, customer records, etc. Keep examples realistic but simple.

### V. Simplicity and Clarity
Prefer straightforward implementations over complex solutions. Code should be easily understandable by demo audiences who may have varying levels of COBOL expertise.

## Technical Standards

### COBOL Standards
- Use COBOL-85 or later standards
- Follow consistent naming conventions for data items and paragraphs
- Include meaningful comments for complex logic
- Use proper file handling and error checking

### Data Management
- Keep data files simple and easy to populate with demo data
- Use sequential or indexed files as appropriate
- Ensure data structures are self-documenting

## Demo Requirements

### Presentation Quality
- Code must compile without errors or warnings
- Include sample data that demonstrates key features
- Maintain clean, readable formatting for code walkthroughs
- Document any setup or execution steps clearly

### Feature Scope
- Implement complete, working features rather than stubs
- Each feature should be independently demonstrable
- Avoid half-implemented or placeholder functionality

## Governance

This constitution guides all development for the COBOL Banking demo application. The focus is on creating clean, demonstrable code that showcases COBOL programming in a banking context without the overhead of formal testing processes.
